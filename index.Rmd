## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the US legal system. I found an interesting dataset on Supreme Court decisions released by the Washington University Law schoolâ€”it would be great to analyze historical trends in SCOTUS decision making, or perhaps analyze variations in the Supreme Court decisions vary from public opinion. I may also be interested in studying inequality in the outcomes of children in the US, depending on where they grow up . Differences or similarities in life outcomes dependings on where kids grow up in the US would be very interesting to me.
